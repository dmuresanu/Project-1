## Features

### Existing Features

-   __F1 Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all three pages of the website supporting easy navigation.  It includes a simple Logo, Home page, Gallery and Contact links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes.  On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the Home, Menu and Contact links move into a dropdown menu on the right-hand side

      ![Dekstop Navbar](documentation/supp-images/F1-nav-bar.png)
    

-   __F2 Landing Page image and call to action__

    - The landing area includes a photograph and a text that together clearly identify the purpose of the business and the type of service it sells. 

    - A "Book Your Appointment" button is placed central to the screen as an eye-catching call to action which gives the user an obvious quick route to the contact page.

      ![Landing Area](documentation/supp-images/F2-landing.png)

- __F3 Ideals__

    - The company ideals are presented using 3 sections on the main page.  These sections give the user more information about the company in relation to its mission and services provided.
    
      ![Company Ideals](documentation/supp-images/F3-company-ideals.png)

- __F05 Footer__

    - The footer is featured on all three pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.  It contains three sections :

        - Opening Times - having the opening times in the footer on each page allows the user to quickly and easily find this information, this is important for this type of business as it is information that the user needs in order to make use of the company (product is sold offline).

        - Address - similar to the opening times, the address of this type of business is important to the user in order for them to use the company and so has been repeated on each page in the footer to allow the user to quickly and easily find out where the company is located 

        - Stay in Touch - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As THRIVE is a ficticious company, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

      ![Footer](documentation/supp-images/f05-footer.png)

- __F06 Menu Page - 'Carte' section__

    - The menu page gives a list of the products that can be purchased at THRIVE.  For ease of use and clarity for the user the products have been split into three panels, one for 'Fresh Juices', one for 'Smoothies', and the third for 'Healthy Snacks and Hot Drinks'.  Pricing and ingredients are also shown.
    
    - For ease of use, a consistent look and feel is maintained through the use of the same background image as is used for the landing image on the main page, and in applying the same background colour to the menu panels as is used on the overlay text area on the main page.  Text colour is kept simple for readability and to minimise distraction.

       ![Menu Page](documentation/supp-images/f06-menu.png)


- __F07 Contact Page - 'Contact Us'__

    - The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, sign up to the company mailing list to get discount codes and offers.  The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message.  By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email.  Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they submitted displayed)

      ![Contact Us](documentation/supp-images/f07-contact-us.png)

- __F08 Contact Page - 'How to Find Us'__

    - The 'How to Find Us' panel of the Contact page gives the user an interactive google map showing the location of the company along with details on full address, phone number and administration email address in large font to make it easily readable.  By clicking the 'View larger map' link the user can go to the google maps site for the address - this opens in a separate tab to allow ease of navigation.

      ![Find Us](documentation/supp-images/f08-find-us.png)


- __How these features support the User Stories__

    - The User Stories in the [User Experience (UX)](#user-experience-ux) part of this document are numbered and categorised into groups A (first time visitor), B (returning visitor) and C (frequent visitor).  The existing features are listed above as F01 to F08.  Below is a traceability matrix cross-referencing the user stories with the features, illustrating which features support which stories :

    ![User Story Feature Matrix](documentation/supp-images/us-feat-matrix.png)

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Company Timeline__
    - A 'Company Timeline' page could be added to provide more information on the evolution of the business for users who would like to know more about the origins of the company, its ethos and its involvement with the community.

- __Navigation bar improvements__
    - The functionality of the navigation bar could be extended to make it "sticky" so that it would be available to the user without scrolling.
    - A hamburger menu could be implemented to save space on smaller screens.

## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero and large background images have been chosen because they are eye-catching, fresh and bright.  The citrus and light pastel colours in the images were chosen to help convey a sense of energy, health and freshness.  The images depict fruit to align with the main business goal of selling juices and smoothies and were chosen for their "simplicity" (- e.g. a single type of fruit or repeating theme) to help keep the site clear and easy to use.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A citrus/pastel palette was chosen to convey a fresh, energetic mood.  The colours picked were inspired by a palette from [Lily Bug Design](https://www.lilybugdesign.co.nz/colour-wall)

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/supp-images/citruspalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Lato and Oswald fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they work well together and have a simple, unembellished, modern feel that is easy to read.


-   ### Wireframes

    -   #### Main Page Wireframes

        ![Main](documentation/wireframes/index-page.png)

    -   #### Menu Page Wireframes

        ![Menu](documentation/wireframes/menu-page.png)
