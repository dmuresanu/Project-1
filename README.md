## Features

### Existing Features

-   __F1 Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all three pages of the website supporting easy navigation.  It includes a simple Logo, Home page, Gallery and Contact links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes.  On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the Home, Menu and Contact links move into a dropdown menu on the right-hand side

      ![Dekstop Navbar](documentation/supp-images/F1-nav-bar.png)
    

-   __F2 Landing Page image and call to action__

    - The landing area includes a photograph and a text that together clearly identify the purpose of the business and the type of service it sells. 

    - A "Book Your Appointment" button is placed central to the screen as an eye-catching call to action which gives the user an obvious quick route to the contact page.

      ![Landing Area](documentation/supp-images/F2-landing-page.png)

- __F3 Ideals__

    - The company ideals are presented using 3 sections on the main page.  These sections give the user more information about the company in relation to its mission and services provided.
    
      ![Company Ideals](documentation/supp-images/F3-company-ideals.png)

- __F4 Testimonials__

    - The customers feedback is presented using testimonial sections on the main page.  These sections give the user more information about the feedback received in relation to its services provided.
    
      ![Testimonials](documentation/supp-images/F4-testimonials.png)

- __F5 Footer__

    - The footer is featured on all three pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.  It contains four sections :

        - Address - similar to the opening times, the address of this type of business is important to the user in order for them to use the company and so has been repeated on each page in the footer to allow the user to quickly and easily find out where the company is located 

        - Opening Times - having the opening times in the footer on each page allows the user to quickly and easily find this information, this is important for this type of business as it is information that the user needs in order to make use of the company (product is sold offline).

        - Follow Us - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As THRIVE is a ficticious company, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

        - Don't Miss Out - this area has a quick form that the user can use to subscribe to the company newsletter so is not missing out on tips and special offers

      ![Footer](documentation/supp-images/F5-footer.png)

- __F6 Gallery page__

    - The gallery page gives a portofolio of past cutomers where users can see the services provided by Glamour Glow
    
    - A "Book Your Appointment" button is placed central under the portofolio as an eye-catching call to action which gives the user an obvious quick route to the contact page.

       ![Gallery Page](documentation/supp-images/F6-gallery.png)


- __F07 Contact Page - 'Contact Us'__

    - The 'Contact Us' panel of the Contact page allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the company and if they want, sign up to the company mailing list to get discount codes and offers.  The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message.  By default, the option to join the mailing list is set to 'no' - to prevent them accidentally signing up for the mailing list and getting unwanted email.  Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they submitted displayed)

      ![Contact Us](documentation/supp-images/F7-contact-us.png)

- __F08 Contact Page - 'Our Location'__

    - The 'Our Location' panel of the Contact page gives the user an interactive google map showing the location of the company along with details on full address in large font to make it easily readable.  By clicking the 'View larger map' link the user can go to the google maps site for the address - this opens in a separate tab to allow ease of navigation.

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Booking system implementation__
    - Allows efficient allocation of staff and resources by providing real-time visibility into appointment schedules and availability.

    - Clients can easily reschedule or cancel appointments online, providing flexibility for both parties and reducing the need for manual adjustments.

    - Demonstrates professionalism and modernity, aligning with industry standards and expectations, and instilling confidence in potential clients.

## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero and large background images were meticulously selected to exude a warm and inviting ambiance, perfectly aligned with the essence of a makeup salon. Each image was chosen with the intention to convey professionalism, health, and beauty, thereby harmonizing with the primary goal of delivering exceptional makeup artistry services.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  The color palette was picked to make the website feel cozy and welcoming, just like stepping into Glamour Glow. The deep brown adds a touch of class and professionalism, while the lighter brown tones keep things friendly and relaxed. Together, they set the stage for a place where everyone feels at home while getting pampered.

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/supp-images/color-palette.png)

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Great Vibes, Josefin Sans, Montserrat and Playfair Display fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they create a visually engaging and harmonious design. These fonts blend elegance, modernity, and readability, enhancing the overall aesthetic and user experience. This thoughtful mix ensures that the text is both attractive and easy to read, contributing to a polished and professional look throughout the website.
